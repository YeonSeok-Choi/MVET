Description: Multivariate estimation and testing, currently a package for testing parametric data. To deal with parametric data, various multivariate normality tests and outlier detection are performed and visualized using the ggplot2 package. Homogeneity tests for covariance matrices are also possible, as well as the Hotelling's T-square test and the MANOVA test. We are exploring additional tests and visualization techniques, such as 'Profile Analysis' and 'Randomized Complete Block Design', to be made available in the future and making them easily accessible to users.
